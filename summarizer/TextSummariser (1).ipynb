            "Additional Information On How We Handle Your Data. Please also read WhatsApp’s Terms of Service (\"Terms\"), which describe the terms under which you use and we provide our Services. Our Privacy Policy (\"Privacy Policy\") helps explain our data practices, including the information we process to provide our Services. This also includes information about when you registered to use our Services; the features you use like our messaging, calling, Status, groups (including group name, group picture, group description), payments or business features; profile photo, \"about\" information; whether you are online, when you last used our Services (your \"last seen\"); and when you last updated your \"about\" information. Changing Your Mobile Phone Number, Profile Name And Picture, And “About” Information. We will provide you notice of amendments to this Privacy Policy, as appropriate, and update the “Last modified” date at the top of this Privacy Policy. The following scenarios describe circumstances where we may store your messages in the course of delivering them:\n",
            "Undelivered Messages. We offer end-to-end encryption for our Services. End-to-end encryption means that your messages are encrypted to protect against us and third parties from reading them. Learn more about end-to-end encryption and how businesses communicate with you on WhatsApp. You can add other information to your account, such as a profile picture and \"about\" information. Even if you do not use our location-related features, we use IP addresses and other information like phone number area codes to estimate your general location (e.g., city and country). You can manage your contacts, groups, and broadcast lists, or use our “block” feature to manage the users with whom you communicate. For example, we work with them to distribute our apps; provide our technical and physical infrastructure, delivery, and other systems; provide engineering support, cybersecurity support, and operational support; supply location, map, and places information; process payments; help us understand how people use our Services; market our Services; help you connect with businesses using our Services; conduct surveys and research for us; ensure safety, security, and integrity; and help with customer service. You can delete your WhatsApp account at any time (including if you want to revoke your consent to our use of your information pursuant to applicable law) using our in-app delete my account feature. If any of your contacts aren’t yet using our Services, we’ll manage this information for you in a way that ensures those contacts cannot be identified by us. You can also change your profile name, profile picture, and \"about\" information at any time. We also use information we have to understand how people use our Services; evaluate and improve our Services; research, develop, and test new services and features; and conduct troubleshooting activities. You must provide your mobile phone number and basic information (including a profile name of your choice) to create a WhatsApp account. You share your information (including messages) as you use and communicate through our Services. We work with these companies to support our Services, such as to provide technical infrastructure, delivery and other systems; market our Services; conduct surveys and research for us; protect the safety, security, and integrity of users and others; and assist with customer service.

            "Law, Our Rights, And Protection\n",
            "We access, preserve, and share your information described in the \"Information We Collect\" section of this Privacy Policy above if we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to: (a) respond pursuant to applicable law or regulations, legal process, or government requests; (b) enforce our Terms and any other applicable terms and policies, including for investigations of potential violations; (c) detect, investigate, prevent, or address fraud and other illegal activity or security, and technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of our users, WhatsApp, the other Meta Companies, or others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. We use information we have to operate and provide our Services, including providing customer support; completing purchases or transactions; improving, fixing, and customizing our Services; and connecting our Services with Meta Company Products that you may use. In addition, some businesses might be working with third-party service providers (which may include Meta) to help manage their communications with their customers. There are certain settings relating to location-related information which you can find in your device settings or the in-app settings, such as location sharing. This includes:\n",
            "\n",
            "helping improve infrastructure and delivery systems;\n",
            "understanding how our Services or theirs are used;\n",
            "promoting safety, security, and integrity across the Meta Company Products, e.g., securing systems and fighting spam, threats, abuse, or infringement activities;\n",
            "improving their services and your experiences using them, such as making suggestions for you (for example, of friends or group connections, or of interesting content), personalizing features and content, helping you complete purchases and transactions, and showing relevant offers and ads across the Meta Company Products; and\n",
            "providing integrations which enable you to connect your WhatsApp experiences with other Meta Company Products. If you use our Services with such third-party services or Meta Company Products, we may receive information about you from them; for example, if you use the WhatsApp share button on a news service to share a news article with your WhatsApp contacts, groups, or broadcast lists on our Services, or if you choose to access our Services through a mobile carrier’s or device provider’s promotion of our Services. Businesses may send you transaction, appointment, and shipping notifications; product and service updates; and marketing. We use information we have to verify accounts and activity; combat harmful conduct; protect users against bad experiences and spam; and promote safety, security, and integrity on and off our Services, such as by investigating suspicious activity or violations of our Terms and policies, and to ensure our Services are being used legally. When you contact us for customer support or otherwise communicate with us, you may provide us with information related to your use of our Services, including copies of your messages, any other information you deem helpful, and how to contact you (e.g., an email address). Your information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in, the United States; countries or territories where the Meta Companies’ affiliates and partners, or our service providers are located; or any other country or territory globally where our Services are provided outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this Privacy Policy. It also explains the steps we take to protect your privacy, like building our Services so delivered messages aren’t stored by us and giving you control over who you communicate with on our Services. Since we started WhatsApp, we’ve built our services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind. As part of the Meta Companies, WhatsApp partners with Meta to offer experiences and integrations across Meta’s family of apps and products. If you don’t provide us with this information, you will not be able to create an account to use our Services. WhatsApp uses Meta’s global infrastructure and data centers, including in the United States. If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if the recipient is offline), we keep it in encrypted form on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver it. Payment account and transaction information includes information needed to complete the transaction (for example, information about your payment method, shipping details and transaction amount). Users, including businesses, with whom you communicate can store or reshare your information (including your phone number or messages) with others on and off our Services. If you interact with a third-party service or another Meta Company Product linked through our Services, such as when you use the in-app player to play content from a third-party platform, information about you, like your IP address and the fact that you are a WhatsApp user, may be provided to such third party or Meta Company Product. When you or others use third-party services or other Meta Company Products that are integrated with our Services, those third-party services may receive information about what you or others share with them. These companies may provide us with information about you in certain circumstances; for example, app stores may provide us with reports to help us diagnose and fix service issues. The storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis that depends on factors like the nature of the information, why it is collected and processed, relevant legal or operational retention needs, and legal obligations. Your phone number, profile name and photo, \"about\" information, last seen information, and message receipts are available to anyone who uses our Services, although you can configure your Services settings to manage certain information available to other users, including businesses, with whom you communicate. For example, if you use a data backup service integrated with our Services (like iCloud or Google Drive), they will receive information you share with them, such as your WhatsApp messages.\n"
